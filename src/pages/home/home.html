    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
    <p>Centennial College's three-year Software Engineering Technology program grants qualified college or university graduates with a background in software direct admission into year two (semester three) so they may receive their advanced diploma in two years (four semesters).

    Through coverage of modern programming languages, design and algorithm concepts, data management tools, systems integration, enterprise programming, mobile computing and software security, you learn to design, develop and maintain software systems.

    The course work in this Software Engineering Technology (Fast-Track) program emphasizes object-oriented software design methodologies, user-oriented interface design, software testing and QA, C#, Java, Java EE, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, Unix/Linux, Microsoft's .NET, HTML5/XML, Ajax and rich Internet applications technologies, mobile application development, cloud computing, data mining and more.

    To highlight the applied focus of the curriculum, this college technology program includes two software development projects that require you to use all the technical and business skills you acquired in the program as you build higher quality software.</p>

    <h3>Co-op Option</h3>
    <p>The co-op option in this program will provide you with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience while you complete three work terms as a paid employee in the field. This experience not only allows you to put classroom learning into practice, but will also provide valuable contacts for your future career.

    To participate in programs with optional co-op, students will typically complete an application process in the second semester of their studies, and if academically qualified, will be admitted to the co-op program. When you graduate, your diploma will highlight the co-op credential.</p>
